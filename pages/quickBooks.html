                    <p>The array of QuickBooks products have really grown in the past years. There are specific products for different needs.
                    Save time and money by getting it right the first time. Feel free to call or email to find out what is best for you.</p>
                    <p><a href="#" alt="">Reasons</a> you might consider using QuickBooks.</p>
                    <p>Setup is critical. Here is where a small investment early in the process really pays off. We see a lot of accounting
                    systems not setup properly. Sometimes there are many hours of data entry that provide little or no benefit. When your
                    starting out with a new accounting system, it pays to have it set up properly. We can get you setup for as little as
                    $450. This will provide better reports, better information for decision making and less costly tax preparation. Also we
                    can provide monthly support plans that start at $60 per month.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 text-center font-weight-bold">QuickBooks Tips</h3>
                    <p><strong>Check your Open Invoices Report</strong></p>
                    <p>Periodically check your Open Invoices Report. Customers listed in this report owe you money, or possibly have a credit
                    (shown as a negative amount) reflecting the amount they have overpaid. If a customer had an invoice and paid it in full
                    it should not appear on this report.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                        <li class="list-group-item">Do you have customers with invoices and payments listed but a zero balance?</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Do you have customers with invoices and credits listed but a zero balance?</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Do you have customers with balances for which you will never collect?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">You may need to create credit memos. Also, you may need to apply these payments or credits an open invoice. Having this report correct is important to create accurate customer statements. See <a href="" alt="">Creating and Applying Credit Memos</a> for more detailed instructions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Use Excel to Customize Reports</strong></p>
                    <p>QuickBooks has more report options when combined with Microsoft Excel. Once you find the best report in QuickBooks and
                    then click on the “Excel” button at the top of the report window. You will have greater flexibility in customizing your
                    report.</p>
                    <p><strong>Using Computerized Checks</strong></p>
                    <p>If it takes you a lot of time to pay bills, consider using computerized checks. Just enter the address and payment nformation once, then use windowed envelopes to send out checks quickly. For fast service, we offer QuickBooks and Quicken "voucher" checks. These checks provide security features, magnetic encoding (MICR ink) and compatibility with QuickBooks, and Quicken programs. <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intuit <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and other vendors offer computer checks but you should allow a couple of weeks for delivery. If you need faster service, we can process your order in 2 days. Unfortunately, we do not offer shipping but you can pick it up at our office.</p>
                    <p><strong>Memorized Transactions</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a great time saving feature in QuickBooks. Here is how to do it:</p>
                    <p>Enter the transaction as you'd like it memorized. If the content of certain fields will change each time you recall the
                    transaction, leave those fields blank. For example, you might want to leave the amount field blank on your monthly
                    utility bill. That way, you can fill in the amount each time you recall the bill.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>From the Edit menu, choose Memorize.</li>
                        <li>Enter a name that will help you recognize the transaction on the Memorized Transaction list.</li>
                        <li>Choose how you want QuickBooks to treat the transaction. You can just be reminded or QuickBooks can enter the
                        transaction automatically.</li>
                        <li>Click OK to memorize the transaction.</li>
                        <li>If you are only entering the transaction information for memorization purposes, click "Cancel" to close the
                        transaction window. If you save this transaction it will record it as any other saved transaction.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you have transactions that occur often such as monthly checks or recurring invoices for clients you can save time by
                    memorizing the details of the transactions. Once you memorize a transaction, you can have QuickBooks reenter it for you
                    at any time. To enter a memorized transaction only when you wish, click the “Lists” menu then select “Memorized
                    Transactions”. Click on the transaction you want to enter and click on “Enter Transaction”. You can even have QuickBooks
                    automatically enter the transaction at intervals you specify or just remind you that it needs to be entered.</p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">You can
                        memorize the following transactions:
                        <li class="list-group-item">Invoices</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Statement Charges</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Automatic deposits (not payments to be applied to invoices)</li>

                        <li class="list-group-item">Bills</li>
                    </ul>

                    either at your location or my office. There is no cost for this initial meeting. From this information we can quote a
                    price for setting up your company.</p>
                    <p>The next step is to setup the information you provide into a QuickBooks company file. We would do this work at our
                    office. Some additional information may be requested.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we would meet at your location so that I can bring this new file into your system. Some basic training is
                    provided at that time.</p>
                    <p>Let us know if you would like to setup an appointment.</p>

                    <ol><strong>For customer balances that need adjustment, create a credit memo.</strong>
                        <li>Go to “Reports” drop-down menu. Go to “Customers and receivables”. Then choose “Open invoices”. Print this report. (You can, as an alternative, keep this report open for the following steps.)</li>
                        <li>Go to the “Customers” drop down menu. Choose “Create credit memos/refunds”.</li>
                        <li>Enter the customer name as it appears on your “Open Invoice” report.</li>
                        <li>Use the same item as was used in the open invoices. (This is not critical as long as this is item is linked to an income
                        account.)</li>
                        <li>Enter the amount of bad debt (the amount you will not collect). Save the transaction.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ol><strong>To apply credit memos to outstanding invoices, use these steps. This is necessary when a customer has a zero balance and
                    is still shown on the “Open invoice” report. When these credit memos (or payments) are applied to open invoices, the
                    customer will not appear on this list. This part of QuickBooks is not intuitive so read these steps closely.</strong><br>
                        <li>Go to the “Customers” drop-down menu. Choose “Receive Payments”.</li>
                        <li>Enter the customer name.</li>
                        <li>You'll notice that there is an “unused credit” amount toward the bottom of this form equal to the amount of the
                        outstanding invoice.</li>
                        <li>Click on the outstanding invoice line (not on the check mark column). This should highlight the invoice line in black.
                        This tells QuickBooks which invoice you want to apply the credit.</li>
                        <li>Click the button named “Set Credits”.</li>
                        <li>Check the credit amount you wish to apply. Then choose “Done”.</li>
                        <li>Now, your “Open invoice” report should not show this customer (if the balance is zero and all payments/credits have been
                        applied).</li>
                    </ol>
